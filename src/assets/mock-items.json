You don't need to be an expert in any of these technologies, but having some sense of them before reading is recommended this book, which is ideal for intermediate to advanced users. What You Will Learn Bootstrap a NativeScript for Angular app Best practices for project organization Style your app with CSS/SASS Use Angular together with NativeScript to create cross-platform mobile apps Take advantage of powerful Angular features, such as Dependency Injection, Components, Directives, Pipes, and NgModules right within your NativeScript apps Gain insight into great project organization and best practices Use Objective C/Swift and Java APIs directly from TypeScript Use rich framework features and third-party plugins Style your app with CSS/SASS Integrate @ngrx/store + @ngrx/effects to help with state management Test your app with Karma and Appium In Detail NativeScript is an open source framework that is built by Progress in order to build truly native mobile apps with TypeScript, JavaScript or just Angular which is an open source framework built by Google that offers declarative templates, dependency injection, and fully featured modules to build rich applications. Angular's versatile view handling architecture allows your views to be rendered as highly performant UI components native to iOS and Android mobile platforms. This decoupling of the view rendering layer in Angular combined with the power of native APIs with NativeScript have together created the powerful and exciting technology stack of NativeScript for Angular. This book focuses on the key concepts that you will need to know to build a NativeScript for Angular mobile app for iOS and Android. We'll build a fun multitrack recording studio app, touching on powerful key concepts from both technologies that you may need to know when you start building an app of your own. The structure of the book takes the reader from a void to a deployed app on both the App Store and Google Play, serving as a reference guide and valuable tips/tricks handbook. By the end of this book, you'll know majority of key concepts needed to build a successful NativeScript for Angular app.",

        "description": "Coding with AngularJS For DummiesWell, you're in good hands !But we have a long road, you and me, with lots of things to learn: ).We're living exciting times in Web development. There is a new Angular. A complete rewrite of the good old AngularJS. Why a complete rewrite? Was AngularJS 1.x not enough?I like the old AngularJS very much. In our small company, we have built several projects with it, contributed code to the core framework, trained hundreds of developers (yes, really), and even written a book about it (in French, but that still counts).AngularJS is incredibly productive once you have mastered it. Despite all of this, it doesn't preventus from seeing its weaknesses. AngularJS is not perfect, with some very difficult concepts to grasp, and traps hard to avoid.Most of all, the Web has changed since AngularJS was conceived. JavaScript has changed. ***New frameworks have emerged, with great ideas, or better implementation. We are not the kind of developers to tell you that you should use this tool instead of that one. We just happen to know some tools very well, and know what fits the project. AngularJS was one of those tools, allowing usto build well-tested web applications, and to build them fast. We also tried to bend it where it didn'tfit. Don't blame us, it happens to the best of us.Will Angular be the tool we will use without hesitation in our future projects? It's hard to say right now, because the framework is really young and the ecosystem only just blooming.But Angular has a lot of interesting points, and a vision that few other frameworks have. It has been designed for the Web of tomorrow, with ECMAScript 6, Web Components and Mobile in mind.When it was first announced, I was, like many, sad at first that the 2.0 version would not be a simple update (I'm sorry if you're just learning about it).***But I was also eager to see what solution the talented Google team would come up with.So I started to write this ebook, pretty much after the first commits, reading the design docs, watching the conference videos, reviewing every commit since the beginning. When I wrote my first ebook, about AngularJS 1.x, it was already a stable and known beast. This one is very different, it started when Angular was not even clear in the minds of its designers. Because I knew I wouldlearn a lot, not only about Angular but also about the concepts that would shape the future of Web development, some of which have nothing to do with Angular. And I did. I had to dig a lot about some of these concepts, and I hope that you will enjoy the journey of learning about them, and how they relate to Angular, as much as I did.The ambition of this ebook is to evolve with Angular. If it turns out that Angular is the great framework we hope, you will receive updates with the best practices and some new features as they emerge (and with fewer typos, because, despite our countless reviews, there are probably some left...). And I would love to hear back from you - if some chapters aren't clear enough, if you spot a mistake or if you have a better way for some parts.I'm fairly confident about the code samples, though, as they are all in a real project, with several hundred unit tests. It was the only way to write an ebook with a newborn framework, and to beable to catch all the problems that inevitably arose with each release.Even if you are not convinced by Angular in the end, I'm pretty sure you will have learnt a thing or two along your read.",

        "description": "Build robust modern web applications using .NET 5, Entity Framework Core, and Angular 11 Key FeaturesUpdated with the latest features and additions in ASP.NET Core 5 and Angular 11Design, build, and deploy a Single Page Application or Progressive Web AppAdopt a full stack approach to handle data management, Web APIs, application design, testing, SEO, security, and deploymentBook Description Learning full-stack development calls for knowledge of both front-end and back-end web development. ASP.NET Core 5 and Angular, Fourth Edition will enhance your ability to create, debug, and deploy efficient web applications using ASP.NET Core and Angular. This revised edition includes coverage of the Angular routing module, expanded discussion on the Angular CLI, and detailed instructions for deploying apps on Azure, as well as both Windows and Linux. Taking care to explain and challenge design choices made throughout the text, Valerio teaches you how to build a data model with Entity Framework Core, alongside utilizing the Entity Core Fluent API and EntityTypeConfiguration class. You’ll learn how to fetch and display data and handle user input with Angular reactive forms and front-end and back-end validators for maximum effect. Later, you will perform advanced debugging and explore the unit testing features provided by xUnit.net (.NET 5) and Jasmine, as well as Karma for Angular. After adding authentication and authorization to your apps, you will explore progressive web applications (PWAs), learning about their technical requirements, testing, and converting SWAs to PWAs. By the end of this book, you will understand how to tie together the front end and back end to build and deploy secure and robust web applications. What you will learnImplement a web API interface with ASP.NET Core and consume it with Angular using RxJS observablesSet up an SQL database server using a local instance or a cloud data storePerform C# and TypeScript debugging using Visual Studio 2019Create TDD and BDD unit tests using xUnit, Jasmine, and KarmaPerform DBMS structured logging using third-party providers such as SeriLogDeploy web apps to Windows and Linux web servers, or Azure App Service, using IIS, Kestrel, and nginxWho this book is for This book is for experienced ASP.NET developers who already possess some familiarity with ASP.NET Core and Angular and are looking to learn how to use them effectively together. The fully documented code samples (also available on GitHub) and the step-by-step implementation tutorials make this book easy to follow.",
